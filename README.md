# Ask Me Anything

## How to do it?

The repo is **[github.com/askcncf/ama](https://github.com/askcncf/ama)**

Just [Open an Issue](https://github.com/askcncf/ama/issues/new) and write your question.

## What kind of questions can be asked?

Anything means anything.
* Tech
* Career choices
* Lab Doubts

Anything I can help you with or piques your interest.

Keep in mind that it should **not be unethical**.


**Not be a stackoverflow question**. You are getting an error in a program and you need me to look into it. Please ask such questions on
* [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), if it's a general programming question.


## How can I help?

There are many ways you can help me do this better:
1. **Search before** raising an issue. See if the question you have is already there or not.
2. **Vote on questions** you like or want to be answered first. Likes or any positive emoji will act as a vote.
3. **Most important!** Ask generic questions, which would be helpful to a lot more people. I'll spend most time on questions which shows potential.
